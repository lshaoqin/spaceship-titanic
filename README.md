# spaceship-titanic
Practice project for Kaggle competition [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview). For this problem, I explored using a neural network to perform binary classification.

Some of the code was adapted from this [sample notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/spaceship-titanic-with-tfdf/notebook), but I used PyTorch instead of TensorFlow to help me pick up the PyTorch framework.
